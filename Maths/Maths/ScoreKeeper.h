 Think about the job of this class. It's going to have to track the number of right and wrong answers. It will also need to generate a string representation of the score for logging.
 
 So, we will need 2 properties and 1 method. The properties will track the right and wrong counts. The method will output a string like this: score: 3 right, 2 wrong ---- 60%
 
 You will need to import and instantiate ScoreKeeper in main.m. Run and test your work.
