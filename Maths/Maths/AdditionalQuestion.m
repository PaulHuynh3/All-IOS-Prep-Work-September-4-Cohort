/*OK we also need to know the time difference between startTime and endTime in seconds. We will need to add a method to AdditionQuestion. Let's call this method answerTime. This method should return a calculated value based on the startTime and endTime. The return type is an NSTimeInterval.
 
 To do the calculation use the NSDate method timeIntervalSinceDate:. Look up how to use it here. You will want to round this value to make it more human readable. */
